# Weather app

Simple JS app for getting weather forecast info.

### To run it locally:
1) With node.js installed.
- inside the main directory run commands `npm install` `npm start`
- when the process is finished, your browser will open automatically with running app
2) Since `build/` directory is included, you can try to run in just by opening `index.html`, but there is no 100% guarantee it will work.
